"Introduction. If you can read this, your browser does not support the audio element. Ergonomics is setting, arranging, and using your computer workstation in such a way that it is comfortable, safe, and efficient to use. A good ergonomic design prevents repetitive strain, injuries, pain, and musculoskeletal disorders that may cause long-term disability and helps improve the productivity and performance of the users. This short course will help you in identifying the appropriate body posture while setting up and using the workstation, to prevent any damage caused to the body due to poor ergonomics. It will also help you to identify the proper usage of laptops and smartphones."
"Keep Your Body Position Right.While working for long hours on your workstation, you must have experienced several strains and pains throughout your body. This is the toll that desk work takes on your body. Ignore ergonomics and you risk suffering from numbness, pain, eye strain, eye irritation, back injury, soft tissue injury, nerve compression syndrome, and many more body problems that may result in chronic health problems. A bad posture or a poor setup effects the human body adversely, especially eyes, neck, shoulders, back, wrists, and feet. You need to position your body right to avoid any body-related problems."
"Keep Your Head Straight.If you can read this, your browser does not support the audio element.Do you know that bending the head forward at a 60 degree angle to look down puts 60 pounds of pressure on the neck? Accumulated, this leads to stress on the spine, early wear and tear and potential for an increased risk of acute injury. This is how you should keep your head: The head should be kept straight in such a way that the top of the monitor is at the eye level. If required, adjust your chair’s height. Your eyes should be looking down at your work, and not up. Also, don’t hold your head in one position for long."
"Position Your Neck Correctly.If you can read this, your browser does not support the audio element.Your neck bears the pressure of your head. This is how you should position your neck:"
"Check Your Eyes.If you can read this, your browser does not support the audio element. Have your ever felt your eyes burning, neck aching, vision blurring, or head throbbing? This problem is called eyestrain or Computer Vision Syndrome, in medical terms. Do you know why it happens? Continuously staring at the monitor for long Due to monitor's bright backlight. Due to the glare of the monitor. Sitting too close to the computer. Sitting far away from the computer."
"Take Care of Your Eyes. You can take care of your eyes and reduce eye strain by: Keeping your monitor 20-30 inches away from the eyes. Keeping the top of the monitor at eye level. Using good lighting and avoiding too much artificial or natural light. Turning off any harsh fluorescent lights. Using appropriate font size, neither too big nor too small. Arranging multiple computers properly (stack vertically or arrange in an arc). Using appropriate eyewear. Positioning the monitor to avoid glare, shadows, or reflections on the screen. Using anti-reflection coatings on spectacle lenses to reduce reflections. Having visual variation throughout your day by changing postures. Looking 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes."
"Position Your Shoulders Correctly. An inappropriate body posture can cause excessive stress and discomfort or pain in the shoulders and back. To avoid this, keep your shoulders relaxed by: Adjusting the armrests. If the armrests are causing hindrance, remove them. Adjusting the keyboard height. Not holding the phone up to your ear and not texting for long periods of time. Avoiding looking down by bending the neck as it tends to round the shoulders."
"Place the Wrists Firmly If you can read this, your browser does not support the audio element. Wrists are affected most while working on a keyboard or a mouse. Weak wrists and leg pain are all side effects of a poorly arranged workstation, so arrange your workstation such that it keeps your wrists relaxed and as straight as possible. Adjust the keyboard height so that the elbows are in a slightly open position (100° to 110°), and the wrists and hands are straight. Minimize the strain on your wrists, fingers and thumbs by using a neutral grip when holding your device. A neutral grip is achieved when the wrist is relatively straight and not bent in any direction. If you keep your wrists bent whilst using a mobile device, your fingers and/or thumbs have to work a lot harder than with a neutral grip."
"Position the Feet Appropriately While sitting, your feet should be on the floor in front of you, and your thighs should be slightly below your hips. If your feet are tucking behind you or you are sitting on one leg, or in another awkward position then you need to adjust your chair. Raise or lower your chair so that your feet are flat on the floor and slightly forward from the knees. Your knees should be equal to or slightly lower than your hips. You may require to adjust the height of your chair or use a seat cushion to get in this position. If your feet are dangling, use a foot rest. In case you don’t have a foot rest, use a box or any other strong base of an adequate height below your feet."
"Sit in the Right Posture. While working on your computer, you should have a neutral and relaxed sitting posture. Identify from the list below the features of an acceptable and well-supported posture: Sitting with body close to desk. Head and neck facing forward and in the middle. Arching of the neck or forward extension of the chin. Shoulders relaxed and symmetrical. Elbows slightly closer to the sides of body and in a slightly open position (100° to 110°). Wrists and hands straight. Back supported by the chair backrest. Curved lower part of the backrest fitting into the lower back or the lumbar curve. Hips making an open angle of 100-120 degrees (slightly more than a right angle). Maintaining a small gap of 2-3 fingers between the front of the chair and the back of the knees. Feet lying flat on the floor or on the footrest."
"Alternate Between Sitting and Standing. Involve in some physical activity to avoid the adverse effects of prolonged sitting, such as slow metabolism, low life expectancy, sprains, strains, fatigue, etc. Sitting for long puts pressure on nerves and tissues, causing numb buttocks and pain in legs and feet. Get up and walk when you feel numbness or pain in your body. After each hour of work, take a break or do some activity that uses different muscles of your body for at least 5-10 minutes. Use a a sit-stand work station or go for a brisk walk around the office. Try to get away from your computer during lunch breaks."
"Avoid Ergonomic Injuries. Ergonomic injuries affect muscles, nerves, tendons, joints, ligaments, spinal discs and cartilage in the neck, back, and lower and upper limbs."
